## Customizing Snapshots
Objects can't allways be created and compared 1:1 with a snapshot. Some datatypes or datastructures are too complex to be compared or simply don't make sense to be compared as a whole.  
For this purpose Polaroider offers several possibilities to alter the way objects are mapped, formatted or analyzed.  
All customization is done in the SnapshotOptions on a global scope or per match.
